The requirements and dependencies for running pre-commit and the associated tools you mentioned:

**Python**: `pre-commit` is written in Python, so you need Python installed on your system to use it. This is a prerequisite for installing and running `pre-commit`.

**pip**: You'll need pip, the Python package manager, to install pre-commit. It typically comes bundled with Python, so if you have Python installed, you should have pip as well.

**clang-format** :clang-format is a tool for formatting C, C++, and other source code files. You need to have `clang-format` installed on your system to use it with pre-commit.

**hadolint-docker**: This appears to be a custom linter for Dockerfiles. You'll need to install and configure it according to your project's requirements. Typically, it should be available via a package manager or as a standalone binary.

**shellcheck**: shellcheck is a static analysis tool for shell scripts. You need to have `shellcheck` installed on your system to use it with `pre-commit`. It is often available through package managers like apt, yum, or brew.

**Docker**: If your project involves Docker, you will need to have Docker installed on your system. This is essential for running Docker containers and building images.

**Make** : You mentioned creating a Make target for installing `pre-commit` using pip. This is optional, but it can be a convenient way to manage your project's setup and dependencies.

**Other project-specific dependencies**: Depending on the specific needs of your project, you may have other requirements or dependencies. Make sure to document and manage these appropriately.

However, it's worth noting that the specific requirements can vary from one project to another, and some requirements might exist depending on the project's dependencies and tools.
